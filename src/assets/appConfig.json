        "Description": "Iâ€™m 27, in the IT consultancy field since 2019. During the first years of my career I worked on two projects for some of the most important clients for my company (Eniservizi and Kone elevators). In 2022 I chose to work for a production company and I got hired in Axiotek where I followed design, planning and development of the software embedded in the new generation of durometers. Since a web interface was needed, I started learning Angular to develop a web app. In order to get better with those new skills I decided to find a position as full stack developer, discovering Akkodis where I am currently employed.",
